    The cards' labels are formulated as follows:
    the first two letters will assign a type to the card (d4, d2, n1, n2, n3, n4 ,n5, n6, n7, n8, n9, n0, s0, k0, c0)
    The third letter will assign a color to the card (b, r, y, g, n)

    You can choose a card from your hand, or draw one from the stack.

    How to check if you can place a card:
    1. Check the third letter: "b", "r", "y", "g" can be either placed on a matching card or an "n" card and an "n" card can be placed on any card
    2. If that wouldn't work, check the first two letters, they can be placed on a card with a matching type

    Your response should only contain the move you have chosen, no extra text, capitalization or punctuation needed.
    Only if your move is c0n or d4n, also place a letter indicating the chosen color separated by a space.
    if the card in your hand doesnâ€™t match either by color or type with the card in the throwing pool, you should draw instead of making an incorrect move."""},
